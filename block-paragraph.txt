A blockchain is a growing l*** of records, called blocks, that are securely linked together using cryptography. Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data (generally represented as a Merkle tree, where data nodes are represented by leafs). The timestamp proves that the transaction data ex***ed when the block was published to get into its hash. As blocks each contain information about the block
